Historically, the past is history, and yesterday is history. Asimov is different.
His "Base" series writes "the history of the future", the "history of the distant future", and the "history of tomorrow"!

Asimov, the "future historian", the American "Tai Shigong",
used "epic" strokes and the grand chapters of the "base" series to tell the readers from the "Galaxy".
"Empire", the ups and downs from the first base (usually called the "base") and the second base,
and the ups and downs from the "mule", fully dedicate the "history of the future" to readers.
"Base" is the first part of the "Base" series of trilogy. The Galactic Empire, which has ruled the Milky Way for 12,000 years,
has gradually declined. At this time, only Harry Shedon, a master of the history of mind,
foresaw that everyone in the galaxy will experience a dark period of 30,000 years, full of ignorance,
barbarism, and war in the future. Xie Dun set up a collection of the best scientists in the empire and came to a desolate
planet on the edge of the galaxy to build a "base", hoping that it could become a beacon of hope for future generations of mankind.
However, as the empire gradually declined, the base was surrounded by strong militant neighbors.
Mankind also faces painful choices: surrender to barbaric forces and be willing to be controlled?
Or fight against the danger of being destroyed?

Let us go back to the era when the machine Daniel was not yet manufactured more than 20,000 years ago.
At that time, the earth was still a habitable planet, and human beings were busy making robots...
Three laws of robotics
1. Robots must not harm humans or cause harm to humans due to inaction.
2. Unless the first rule is violated, robots must obey human orders.
3. The robot must protect itself without violating the first and second laws.
Is the logic of the three laws impeccable? Do these three laws make robots more docile or more dangerous? Susan Kevin,
the chief robotic psychologist of "American Robotics Company", recounted the 9 most profound accidents in her memory...

In the 24th century, mankind invented the time force field. In the 27th century,
after mankind mastered time travel technology, they established an organization called Eternity,
which silently guards the development of human society behind each era. Eternal space-time is based on a century,
and fine-tuned according to the development needs of each century, so as to avoid greater harm to society as a whole.
