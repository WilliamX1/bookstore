{"description":"The study of computer complexity theory is one of the important research fields of computer science, and Chistos.H.Papadimitriou is one of the experts in this field. This book is a textbook comprehensively expounding the theory of computer complexity and its progress in recent years. It mainly contains basic concepts related to computational complexity theory such as algorithm Turing machine and computability; Boolean logic, first-order logic, and undecidability in logic The basic knowledge of complexity theory; the core content of complexity theory such as the concepts of P, NP, and NP complete and the relationship between them; random algorithms, approximate algorithms, parallel algorithms and their complexity theories; and Introduction to complexity classes such as polynomial spaces other than NP.","book_id":6}
